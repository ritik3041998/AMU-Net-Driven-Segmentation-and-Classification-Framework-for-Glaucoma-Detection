# AMU-Net-Driven-Segmentation-and-Classification-Framework-for-Glaucoma-Detection
This project presents an automated glaucoma detection framework using Attention Mobile U-Net (AMU-Net) for precise segmentation of fundus images, targeting optic disc and cup boundaries and glaucoma classification.
This project focuses on using machine learning and deep
learning techniques to analyze fundus images for the early
detection and classification of glaucoma. The key steps include:
Fundus Image Segmentation: Extracting key regions of interest
such as the optic disc and optic cup from retinal images. Using
the Attention Mobile U-Net model to accurately segment these
structures, improving precision in identifying the optic disc and
optic cup. Glaucoma Classification: Analyzing the segmented
features to identify patterns associated with glaucoma. Training
a classification model to differentiate between healthy and
glaucomatous eyes with high accuracy. The project aims to
improve early diagnosis, enabling timely treatment and reducing
the risk of vision loss.
